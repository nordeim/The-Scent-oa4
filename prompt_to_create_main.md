Gives the inspiration: the ephemeral beauty of mist, the warmth of global ingredients, and the calm of nature—delivered via modern design, soft motion, and interactive personalization.

## ✹ Design Methodology & Key Elements

**1. Full Hero Immersion**
- **Video Background** with **SVG Animated “Scent Trails”** — Soft, misty curves animate gently across the hero, layered over a calming video and dark gradient. This visualizes aroma in motion.
- **Animated Floating CTA** — The “Shop Now” button pulses and floats with aroma-inspired glow, intuitively drawing action.

**2. Dark & Light Mode**
- **Instant mood shift**: One-click toggle (in nav) transitions every color, mist, accent, and even the hero’s atmosphere. Custom CSS variables and icons create two serene, aromatic palettes—bright wellness or nighttime calm.

**3. Parallax Ingredient Narrative**
- The **About section** brings the artisan/global brand story to life:  
  - Custom ingredient/product images gently move with scroll for a window-into-craft experience.
  - An **interactive ingredient origin map** pulses with provenance and transparency.

**4. Interactive Scent Quiz**
- **Multi-step, inline quiz** guides users—step-by-step, with smooth fade-reveals and animated icons—to their personal aroma match.
- **Dynamic product showcase** at the end gives instant, playful recommendations (not just links).

**5. Products & Testimonials, Alive**
- Cards animate on hover, icons shimmer, micro-interactions throughout.
- **Testimonials** fade in as you scroll, evoking trust and warmth with custom profile icons.

**6. Multisensory Touches**
- **Ambient background sound** (nature/zen, user-toggle mute) invites longer, richer visits.
- Thoughtful, responsive, and accessible—every button/tab/alt-text.

_**Design Rationale:**_  
Each visual, scroll, and interaction is tuned to convey:  
"Nature — Craft — Global Inspiration — Calm — Artisanal Luxury"
