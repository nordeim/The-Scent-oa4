## Final Landing Page Design

### Fullscreen Hero Section

- **Video Background & Fallback:**  
  A full-screen video (with a high-resolution static image fallback) sets a tranquil tone. A semi-transparent overlay and animated SVG "scent trails" create a dynamic and soothing entrance.
  
- **Captivating Messaging & CTA:**  
  Bold typographic treatments announce the brand with a central call-to-action (e.g., “Shop Now”) that invites immediate interaction with subtle animations.

### Interactive Navigation & UI

- **Fixed Header:**  
  A transparent header that becomes solid on scroll includes the logo (enhanced with iconography), clear navigational links, and optional theme toggles.
  
- **Font & Icon Consistency:**  
  Typography from Google Fonts (Cormorant Garamond for headings and Montserrat for body copy) paired with Font Awesome icons ensures a cohesive visual language.

### Immersive Content Sections

- **About Section with Parallax Effect:**  
  A storytelling segment that uses parallax scrolling to reveal background images and text about our global ingredient sourcing and artisanal formulations.
  
- **Dynamic Product Showcase:**  
  A responsive grid layout featuring product images with hover effects that gently scale, shadow, and highlight details. Each card invites deeper exploration.

### Dynamic Product Presentation & Quiz

- **Interactive Multi-Step Scent Quiz:**  
  A quiz guides users step-by-step to discover their ideal aromatherapy match. Animated transitions and iconography create a playful yet informative experience.
  
- **Scroll-Triggered Testimonials:**  
  Customer reviews animate into view, building trust through social proof and a warm narrative tone.

### Elegant Footer & Newsletter

- **Footer Design:**  
  The footer incorporates multiple columns with quick links, contact details, a mini-brand overview, and a styled newsletter subscription box—all matching the attractive color scheme and modern button design.
  
- **Subscription Call-Out:**  
  An integrated form encourages users to subscribe for updates, tips, and exclusive offers, reinforcing community engagement.

## Technical Design Specification

In order to build **The Scent** as a fully functional e-commerce platform, the project is implemented with a custom stack instead of pre-built templates. Our detailed technical design includes the following:

### Technology Stack

- **Server:** Apache HTTP Server  
- **Backend Language:** PHP (custom e-commerce logic, session management, and API endpoints)  
- **Database:** MySQL (for product catalogs, user data, orders, and inventory)  
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, and Vanilla JavaScript (for dynamic interactions and responsiveness)
- **Additional Libraries:** Font Awesome for iconography; Google Fonts for typography.

### Architecture Overview

- **Modular Backend:**  
  The platform is divided into modules for user management, product catalog management, order processing, and content management.
  
- **RESTful API:**  
  Designed to allow smooth communication between the frontend and backend, handling asynchronous requests for dynamic content (such as the scent quiz and product filters).
  
- **MVC Pattern:**  
  The PHP application follows the Model-View-Controller pattern to separate business logic, UI, and data manipulation.

### Module Breakdown

1. **User Module:**  
   Handles customer registration, login, profile management, and secure session handling.

2. **Product Module:**  
   Manages product listings, detailed view pages, filtering, and dynamic content updates from the MySQL database.
   
3. **Order Module:**  
   Processes shopping cart, checkout flows, payment integration, and order tracking.
   
4. **Content Management:**  
   Provides backend administrative tools to update landing page content, blog articles, newsletters, and testimonials.
   
5. **Interactive Elements:**  
   Manages the dynamic scent quiz and interactive UI components, with lightweight JavaScript for enhanced interactivity.

### Integration & Deployment

- **Development Environment:**  
  Apache/PHP environment configured locally for development, with version control via Git.
  
- **Database Schema:**  
  A normalized MySQL database schema designed to handle product data, user records, orders, and site settings.
  
- **Deployment Strategy:**  
  Incremental deployment using a staging environment before pushing to production. Automated backups and version control ensure continuity and reliability.
  
- **Security Considerations:**  
  Rigorous sanitization and validation of all user inputs, secure session management, and regular security patches to protect sensitive customer data.
